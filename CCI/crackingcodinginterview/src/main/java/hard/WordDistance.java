Word Distance: You have a large text file containing words. Given any two words, find the shortest
distance (in terms of number of words) between them in the file. If the operation will be repeated
many times for the same file (but different pairs of words), can you optimize your solution?

    then we can do is like
    kapil - 34, 60, 78, 90, 118, 874
    awesome - 67, 89, 290, 900

    now we can iterate these lists and calculate the min gap in O(length of occurrences)
