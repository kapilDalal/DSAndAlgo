package jav.rev.threadgroup;

/*
ThreadGroup creates a group of threads.
It offers a convenient way to manage groups of threads as a unit.
This is particularly valuable in situation in which you want to
suspend and resume a number of related threads.

The thread group form a tree in which every thread group except the initial thread group has a parent.
A thread is allowed to access information about its own thread group but not to access information
about its thread groupâ€™s parent thread group or any other thread group.
